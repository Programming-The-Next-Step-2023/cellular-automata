# Lively Cells
An R Shiny App for Conway´s Game of Life and other Life-Like Cellular Automata

## Description
This is an R package which contains an R Shiny App for life-like cellular automata  
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton).

At time point zero, the player uses their mouse to bring some cells in the
automaton to life.  
Over time, cells in the automaton are then born and survive depending on a set
of rules.  
By default, the rules will be those from Conway´s Game of Life  
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).  
However, other rules can also be selected.
