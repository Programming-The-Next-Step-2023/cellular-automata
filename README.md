# Lively Cells
An R Shiny App for Conway´s Game of Life

## Description
This is an R package which contains an R Shiny App for
Conway´s Game of Life
(see wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).

At time point zero, the player uses their mouse to bring some cells to life.  
Then, the cells evolve over time and show all sorts of interesting behaviour.

This package was build with the help of code from the pixeltrix package
(github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix) by Matt Dray (matt-dray.com/).
However, it does not require the installation of pixeltrix.
