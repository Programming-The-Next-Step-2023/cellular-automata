# Shiny Life-Like Cells
An R Shiny App for Conway´s and other Games of Life

## Description
The goal of this project is an R Shiny App for life-like cellular automata  
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-like_cellular_automaton).

At time point zero, the player uses their mouse to bring some cells in the
automaton to life.
Over time, cells in the automaton are then born and survive depending on a set
of rules.  
By default, the rules will be those from Conway´s Game of Life  
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
However, I also aim to implement "Life without Death", "Day and Night", and "Seeds".

It will also be possible to change the color-coding for live and dead cells.
And the overall look/design will be minimalistic with references to a
biological laboratory and a petri dish.
