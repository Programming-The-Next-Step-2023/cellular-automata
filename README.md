# Lively Cells
An R Shiny App for Conway´s Game of Life

## Description
This is an R package which contains an R Shiny App for
[Conway´s Game of Life](<http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life>).  
Aside from shiny, livelycells has no dependencies.

At time point zero, the player uses their mouse to click some cells to life.  
Then, the cells evolve over time and show all sorts of interesting behavior.  
There are also preset patterns.

This package was build with the help of code from the
[pixeltrix package](<http://github.com/matt-dray/pixeltrix>) by [Matt Dray](<http://matt-dray.com/>).
